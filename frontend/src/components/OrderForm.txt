OrderForm.jsx
------------------------------
    - Main entry point for creating a new order.
    - Manages the: 
        - The order number
        - A list of individual drain entries
 
STRUCTURE:
------------------------------
    - OrderNumber: input field for entering the order number.
    - OrderFormDrains: form used to create a single drain (box type, dome, ring, etc.).
    - Add Drain button: adds a blank drain entry for the user to fill out.
    - Order Summary: shows a preview of the added drains.
    - Submit Order button: submits the entire order.

    - `drainEntries` is a hash map of all drains added to the order.
    Format:
        {
        "Drain-1": { box: "MuleHide", dome: "AL Dome", ... },
        "Drain-2": { box: "TruFast", dome: "Blue Dome", ... }
        }
 
    - When the user fills out a drain and clicks "Add to Order" in OrderFormDrains:
     -> `handleAddToOrder` is called, saving that drain into `drainEntries`.
     -> A fresh new drain form is immediately shown.


NOTE:
------------------------------
    - We still need to implement a remove feature incase an entry is a misinput
    - A lot of the entries in the Order Form, such as the boxes, rings, etc; are modularized in src/components/Drain Options
